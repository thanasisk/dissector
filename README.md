# Dissector

## What is this?
The following script is an aid automating analysis for `.eml` email files.
## Why?
We all love spam, don't we?
## Prerequisites
- Bash (standard on MacOS / Linux)
- Python3 (standard on MacOS / Linux )
- `emlAnalyzer` -( not standard - `pip install eml-analyzer` will do the trick )
## Usage
`./dissector.sh <eml file you want to analyze>`.
This will create a directory in the format of `eml_analysis.?` and store relevant results there, in a standardized format.
Filenames and `eml_analysis.?` structure aims to be self-explanatory.
